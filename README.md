AWS Project: Architect and Build an End-to-End AWS Web Application from Scratch, Step by Step
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m_q1ldzw0U
A project to design and build a simple web application from scratch. 
I picked five different services —
Amplify - To host the front-end
Lambda
IAM - To create a Lambda Role to enable read-write privilege to DynamoDB
API Gateway - To facilitate integration between the frontend and backend
DynamoDB— TO store NoSQL data from the app


We got them to work with each other and build out each of the services, resulting in a fully-functional math web application.
